🧠 Git Quick Guide (Beginner Version)
git add .          <-- add all your changes
git commit -m ""   <-- write a short message about what you changed
git push           <-- upload your changes to GitHub
git pull           <-- download new changes from others

⚠️ If You See a “CONFLICT”

That means you and someone else edited the same file and Git doesn’t know which version to keep.

How to Fix It

Open the file with the conflict.
You’ll see something like this:

<<<<<< HEAD
your version
=======
their version
>>>>>> main


Decide what to keep.

You can keep your version,

or keep theirs,

or mix both together.

Delete the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).

Save the file, then run:

git add .
git commit
git push

💡 Tip to Avoid Conflicts

Before you start working each time, always run:

git pull


That keeps your local files up to date with your teammates’ changes.
