# ICK Team Project

📽️ Movie App — Pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a frontend-only movie web application built using vanilla HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. It transforms our shared Figma design into a fully
responsive website where movies are displayed in a clean, modern interface.

Users can browse movie cards, view details, and explore the layout without the
use of any frameworks or libraries — focusing purely on core web technologies
and responsive design principles.

The goal of this project is to practice building dynamic UI components using
only native browser features like the DOM, Fetch API, and local JSON data, while
maintaining clean and scalable front-end structure.

## 🎯 Goal

Build a clean, pixel-perfect version of the Figma design while maintaining good
folder organization, reusable components, and clear communication through Slack.
